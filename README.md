## Project Description

The **TaipeiTech_FishRobot_Control** project showcases the integration of AI for real-time control of a bionic robotic fish. This control system includes:

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: A model capable of recognizing and interpreting various hand gestures, allowing users to control the fish’s movements in water.
- **Voice Command Integration**: A voice control system that enables hands-free operation by recognizing specific voice commands.
- **Optimization for Jetson Nano**: The AI models have been meticulously optimized to run on Jetson Nano, ensuring smooth performance even with low frames per second (FPS).

### Context

This project was developed as part of an advanced AI Robotics course at Taipei Tech. The primary focus was to create a responsive and interactive control mechanism for a robotic fish that can be deployed in educational, research, or hobbyist environments. The use of Jetson Nano as the computational platform highlights the model’s efficiency and suitability for edge computing scenarios.
